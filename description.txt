Build Your Own National Park - Web Game

Purpose: The purpose of this app is to empower users to build a virtual experience of their wildest dreams. This app, once developed, will allow those who have a profound appreciation for nature to channel their hopes and dreams into a digital world of their own creation. There has been a gap in the industry for plant and animal lovers since the creation of the web itself, and this game solves it in three distinct ways:
Creation of a 3rd Space - psychologists have been articulating the lack of third spaces - communal and undigitized multiplicities -  in our modern society for years. This app creates an extremely accessible third space. 
Problem-Solving Skills - the national park that the users build will be incredibly interactive. The user will have to contend with natural disasters (wildfires, typhoons, etc), weather-related obstacles, and other emergencies. 
Life-long Learning - the user will have to carefully curate their national park to guarantee its flourishing and success. To gamify the platform, users can earn awards for features of their park (diversity of flora and fauna, upkeep, and environmental efforts). 

Target audience: #earth, #saveourplanet, #savethereefs, #marsandbeyond, #spacex, #hydroflask, #owalla, #conserve, #nationalparks, #yosemite, #savetheturtles, #volcanoes, #sequoia, #tree, #flower, #grass, #elcap, #capitan, #astrocamp, #camp, #camping, #glamping, #traveltheworld, #expedition, #againstcorporatenvironmentalism, #anticapitalism, #socialism

Aesthetics: this will be a 3D experience with all the elements of a national park - animals, plants, changing topography, time, weather, and timeline. 
Natural Landscapes
Dynamic Terrain: Create customizable topography with hills, valleys, rivers, and lakes. Allow users to manipulate elevation, water flow, and landforms to design their parks.
Seasonal Changes: Implement a system where the environment changes with the seasons, showcasing vibrant autumn leaves, winter snow, spring blooms, and summer greenery.
Flora and Fauna
Diverse Plant Life: Include various 3D models of trees, shrubs, flowers, and grasses that users can place throughout their parks. Consider offering rare species as rewards for achievements.
Wildlife Models: Create realistic 3D animals (bears, deer, birds, etc.) that interact with the environment. Users could attract specific species by planting particular flora.
Interactive Features
Weather Effects: Introduce real-time weather changes, such as rain, snow, fog, and sunlight. Weather events could affect gameplay (e.g., certain plants thrive in rain).
Natural Disasters: Design engaging simulations of wildfires, floods, and storms. Users could strategize on how to mitigate damage to their parks.
User-Created Structures
Campgrounds and Facilities: Allow users to build campsites, picnic areas, educational centers, and observation decks. These could enhance the park's attractiveness and functionality.
Eco-Friendly Structures: Encourage sustainability by providing options for green buildings (solar panels, rainwater collection systems) that blend into the natural environment.
Community and Social Spaces
Gathering Areas: Design communal spots where avatars of players can meet, share tips, and celebrate achievements, reinforcing the third space concept.
Event Spaces: Create areas for in-game events, like festivals celebrating biodiversity or environmental awareness days, adding a dynamic community aspect.
Gamification Elements
Achievement Badges: Visually appealing badges or trophies for users to earn for various accomplishments, like creating a balanced ecosystem or saving endangered species.
Interactive Quests: Implement tasks that guide users in exploring different features of the park and learning about conservation, enhancing the lifelong learning aspect.
Artistic Style
Vibrant Colors: Use a bright and inviting color palette to evoke a sense of wonder and positivity associated with nature.
Stylized Graphics: Consider a semi-realistic art style that balances realism with a whimsical, playful feel, appealing to a wide range of players.
Sound and Music
Ambient Soundscapes: Incorporate 3D audio with sounds of rustling leaves, flowing water, animal calls, and gentle winds to immerse users in the environment.
Thematic Music: Use soothing background music that changes with the time of day or weather, enhancing the emotional connection to the park.
User Interface (UI)
Intuitive Design: Create a UI that blends seamlessly with the 3D world, using natural elements like leaves or stones for buttons and menus.
Tutorial Elements: Integrate tutorial prompts that guide users through the building process, ensuring that it remains accessible to all skill levels.
